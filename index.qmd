🤓 Hi, I am Minh Nguyễn - a visualization and forecasting lover from Vietnam 🥰 My nickname is Yvesypher = "Yves" (my English name) + "ypher" (from the word "decipher") 😶 This shows my hope to decipher and understand myself better day by day 😁 I have completed my Bachelor degree in Actuarial Science and Honours degree in Business Analytics at Monash University 🧐 My research interests lie in hierarchical forecasting, temporal data visualization, and story telling 🤩
